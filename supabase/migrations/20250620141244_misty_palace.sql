  # Create prayer requests table

  1. New Tables
    - `prayer_requests`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `name` (text, not null)
      - `request` (text, not null)
      - `is_read` (boolean, default false)
      - `created_at` (timestamp with timezone, default now())

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `prayer_requests` table
    - Add policy for public insert (anyone can submit prayer requests)
    - Add policy for authenticated read (only authenticated users can view)
    - Add policy for authenticated update (only authenticated users can mark as read)
    - Add policy for authenticated delete (only authenticated users can delete)
